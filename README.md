# FISTA
FISTA Algorithm for Solving LASSO Problems

FISTA algorithm for LASSO problem: application of sparse regularization in
spherical radial basis functions (SRBFs) based regional geoid modeling;
generalized cross validation (GCV) or corrected Akaike information
criterion (AICc) are used to select the regularization coefficient.

The codes of the FISTA part are originally created by Wen Zaiwen, Liu
Haoyang and Hu Jiang, see:
https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/optbook/pages/lasso_proxg/LASSO_Nesterov_inn.html

Yu Haipeng and Chang Guobin modified the original codes of the FISTA so
that they can be used for local gravity field modeling based on SRBFs.The
analytical expressions of GCV and AICc are derived by Chang Guobin and Yu
Haipeng, who also edited thess parts of the codes.
